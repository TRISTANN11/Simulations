The boundaries change how the cells behave, in specific it kills off the “Gliders”, or the layouts that go around the screen in perpetuity. 
It also killed off sevel layouts that otherwise would turn into stable squares, depending on where you start and the design you began with. 

The patterns that emerge after sufficient time are weird flower shapes that eventually break down into 3 long rectangles that continually flip over and over and stable squares, 
although there is almost always a “colony” moving around that makes contact with one of these stable states and destroys them, leaving a new system that eventually breaks
back down into a stable pattern. When I set P = 20, I got colonies that move around the screen for awhile before most of them broke down into a pattern with 2 on top, one to the 
right and down 1, one to the left and down 1, and then 2 in parallel with the 2 on top. There are several “Colonies” that move around for awhile before this happens, however.
At P=70 almost immediately all the cells die, giving a couple stable patterns and one that bloomed out into a flower and eventually lead to a very similar situation to the P=50 
test case.

The graph below shows what I got when I began with P=50. The left side is the Density(as a percent of cells alive) and the bottom in the iteration (frame) of the animation. 
From this data it is reasonable to assume that the steady state is around <15 % density, thats where it hits and then somewhat stabilizes. I ran this twice with 50 frames and 
then 100 frames to confirm that it doesn’t really hit a stable amount.
